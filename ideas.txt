PopQuiz: A pop culture quiz application that allows logged in/registered users to search for, take, and save their favorite quizzes to their dashboard. Non-registered/logged in users can search and take quizzes, but they are not able to save them to their dashboard.

Using Challenge 21 (MERN Book Search Engine) as a reference--

"Homepage"
- Search bar for quizzes

"Dashboard"
- Any saved quizzes for a logged in user

Navbar and login/sign up modal
- Adjust navbar according to whether a user is logged in or not
- Instead of having login/signup routes, handle using modal

TODOs
- Modify User model to include more validation
- Refactor controllers (and seeds?)
- Update DB to reflect popquiz versus mernstack
- Add search bar / modify quiz form generation
- Address the warnings in terminal (...)
- Keep focus on responsive design
- New browser favicon!

Questions
- How do reviews function in this application? Do we even want to do reviews? Are we interested in implementing a star rating system?
- Better way to do authentication? Feels clunky
